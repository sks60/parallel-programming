#From http://www.ranks.nl/resources/stopwords.html 
#The short
#stopwords list below is based on what we believed to be Google
#stopwords a few years ago, based on words that were ignored if you
#would search for them in combination with another word. (ie. as in the
#phrase "a keyword").  Last time we checked using stopwords in
#search terms did matter, results will be different.
#
#We do believe stopwords (and other non-relevant text parts such as
#navigation menus) are filtered out of the text by Google and other
#search engines to help determine what a page is about.
